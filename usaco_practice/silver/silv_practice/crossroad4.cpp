1) number the cows and chickens
2) for each chicken, record how many cows it can help (use set<int> arr[20005])
3) for each cow, record which chickens can help them.
4) from the chicken with the least cows, cnt++;
5) delete the cow that just crossed from set<int> arr[20005];
6) sort from current+1 to the end by size.
7) Use break when there are no cows (or chicken) left.
